## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Please email me at angusmoore.dev@gmail.com and I will put your name in the list of contributors!

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
