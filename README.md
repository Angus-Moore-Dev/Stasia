A better way to organise your files, customer relationships, internal communications and project management. No need to use external services like Jira, Monday, Copper, Salesforce or some Cloud storage workaround, this is the place to manage the business and growth side of your startup/business.

Currently only in use for Jensen Labs internal operations, we are planning on making it more available to the wider community at a later date.

# How do I run this?
You will need to create your own Supabase instance, it's pretty easy, just go to https://supabase.com/ to get started.

More docs will be written about this shortly
